CDImageMerge is mainly aimed to help in those cases where you know you have corrupt sectors in an ISO image, and happen to come across to/create another image that has those sectors correctly dumped but suffers from other problems.

CDImageMerge lets you:

  * Browse the file structure of the loaded images.
  * Compare sectors between both images.
  * Import sectors from the source image to the destination one.
  * Export sectors to a file to later import them.
  * Fill sectors with a predefined value when some sector has garbage and the original one happened to be filled with the same value.

This is an old application I made several years ago and helped me in several occasions, however, because of several factors it was left in oblivion and never finished. Now I'm expecting to finish working on it as I'm gonna need it once again, and wanted to share it.
