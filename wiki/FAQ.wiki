= CDImageMerge Questions =

 * == Which image formats does CDImageMerge support?==
 CDImageMerge only supports images in plain ISO format. As of August, 2011 there are only plans for adding support to parse .CUE and maybe .CCD files.

 * ==Which CD-ROM formats does CDImageMerge support?==
 The application reads all images as Mode 2/2352. However, adding support for other formats is trivial and planned.

 * ==Does CDImageMerge support DVD images?==
 DVD images are not tested, and therefore not officially supported. However, when the different CD-ROM formats are added they should work as well. This will be eventually looked into, and officially supported.
