= General Questions =

 * ==Why making an application like CDImageMerge?==
 Actually, I used to collect PSX (Sony PlayStation) games back in the day, I like to keep ISOs of my CDs (in fact, I gave most of the games to a friend some time ago), however some of the purchased second hand games turned out to have scratches or some other minor damages that resulted in read errors, that forced me to use other CD/DVD drives to correctly read some of those sectors or get again the games from other sources. Seeing the problem, and without being able to find other applications that would help me in some situations in an optimal way, I decided to write my own application.

 * ==Why using VB.NET?==
 This is just a matter of when and why I started the project: the company where I work mainly uses VB for the software it makes, as a result of this, when I start some quick experiment, or personal project I'm not expecting to share, I often use it as well. The project could be easily converted to C# if desired.


= CDImageMerge Questions =

 * ==Which image formats does CDImageMerge support?==
 CDImageMerge only supports images in plain ISO format. As of August, 2011 there are only plans for adding support to parse .CUE and maybe .CCD files.

 * ==Which CD-ROM formats does CDImageMerge support?==
 The application reads all images as Mode 2/2352. However, adding support for other formats is trivial and planned.

 * ==Does CDImageMerge support DVD images?==
 DVD images are not tested, and therefore not officially supported. However, when the different CD-ROM formats are added they should work as well. This will be eventually looked into, and officially supported.

 * ==Does CDImageMerge support repairing damaged sectors?==
 No, although it would a nice exercise to learn more, I think there are (there is?) already some good applications for this.


= Extensibility Questions =

 * ==Can I extend CDImageMerge functionality?==
 CDImageMerge exposes an ICdImageAction interface that can be implemented in your own class library to add your own features to the application. Once developed, just make sure your resulting assembly filename ends with ".CdImageAction.dll", and place it inside the CDImageMerge folder. Furthermore, CDImageMerge is fully open sourced, so if there is something you cannot easily add by using the built-in interface, you can dive into the code and modify whatever you want.
 If you make your own plugin, or modify something of the provided code I'd love to hear back from you.
